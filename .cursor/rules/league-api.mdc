# League → API Rule

1. **Filename matches action** (`update-result/route.ts`).  
2. `POST` only for mutations; `GET` for reads.  
3. Validate body with **Zod**; return `400` on failure.  
4. Wrap handlers with `try/catch`; on error respond `{ error: "…" }` + `500`.  
5. Rate-limit admin routes to 30 req/min via middleware.
